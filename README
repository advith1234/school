This project uses Apache Ivy to pull down dependencies.  To setup the project in Eclipse for local development (not production), do the following:

1. Checkout from SVN, use New Project wizards, choose Dynamic Web Project, use tomcat 6, give it a name, and click Finish
2. Run the resolve target of the ant build (right click build.xml, Run As, ant build, choose resolve target)
3. Refresh the project to get the updated directories (you'll have new jars in the externalLibs folder, a new sourceLibs folder, and WebContent\WEB-INF\lib)
5. Startup the tomcat server
